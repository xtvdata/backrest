# Managing custom CA (Certificate Authority) running BackRest in Docker

## Introduction

Using a custom CA to generate internal servers certificates is a common practice both in small and large organizations, to simplify the management of TLS certificates, since it's necessary to import a since *custom CA* certificate to fix all issues deriving self-signed certificates.
Moreover, this is a significantly more secure solution, rather than creating self signed certificates for each machine (pure self-signed certificates only enable encryption, but they are not verifieable unless pinned; while using a custom CA allows to recognize that a certificate was generated but the known CA - and not by anyone...).

## Problem

Typically, in Linux, it's enough to install the CA at root level in the system to enable its usage.

However, unfortunately a Docker container will not inherit that automatically, therefore if you have a local S3 compatible storage running on certifictes signed by your local CA, BackRest will not work.

## Solution

Luckily, Restic allows to specify in your preferred CA using an Environment variable.

So, assuming you have installed your *custom CA* in `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/my-CA-certificate.crt`, it's sufficient to alter the Docker-compose file to include:
- an additional read-only volume to access your certificate
- an additional environment variable to tell Restic to use it
like in the following example.

### Sample `docker-compose` file

```docker-compose
version: "3.2"
services:
  backrest:
    image: garethgeorge/backrest:latest-alpine
    container_name: backrest
    network_mode: "host"
    hostname: backrest
    volumes:
      - /srv/backrest/data:/data
      - /srv/backrest/config:/config
      - /srv/backrest/cache:/cache
      - /usr/local/share/ca-certificates:/ca-certificates:ro   # <<<<<
      #- /MY-REPOS:/repos                    # [optional] mount repos if using local storage, not necessary for remotes e.g. B2, S3, etc.
    environment:
      - BACKREST_DATA=/data                 # path for backrest data. restic binary and the database are placed here.
      - BACKREST_CONFIG=/config/config.json # path for the backrest config file.
      - XDG_CACHE_HOME=/cache               # path for the restic cache which greatly improves performance.
      - TZ=Europe/Rome                      # set the timezone for the container, used as the timezone for cron jobs.
      - RESTIC_CACERT=/ca-certificates/$CA_CERT_FILENAME       # <<<<< 
    restart: unless-stopped
```

**NOTE:** in the example above the variable `$CA_CERT_FILENAME` is expanded to `my-CA-certificate.crt`
